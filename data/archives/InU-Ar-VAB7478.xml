    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>From his hometown of Knightstown, Indiana, Ralph James Garriott came to Indiana University in 1923 where he would ultimately earn his BS in Commerce in 1927. From Bloomington, Ralph went to Anderson, Indiana, where he secured an accounting position with the Delco-Remy Corporation, a division of General Motors. He remained there his entire professional career.</p><p>  Having no children themselves, Ralph and his wife Lova Conn left much of their estate to benefit children and young adults. At Indiana University, the Garriotts are memorialized through the Lova C. Garriott Scholarship at the Kelley School of Business.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The 1923-1924 diary of Ralph Garriott chronicles his freshman year at Indiana University. Devoted to his journal, Ralph wrote daily with entries detailing his classes, friends, happenings outside of class, as well as news from home and elsewhere. Ralph seemed to be interested in many of the popular happenings on campus, so in addition to talk about his classes, there are entries about athletic events (IU-Purdue football and burial of Jawn Purdue), dances ("Blanket Hop"), freshman-sophomore scraps, serenades, and popular movies ("My Wild Irish Rose").</p>  </scopecontent>
