    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>John Flesher Newsom was born to Nathan N. Newsom and Mary Flesher Newsom on September 6, 1869. He was born in Elizabethtown, IN, and visited there often even after moving to Stanford, CA. There is mention in the IDS of a brother that he may have had, however there is no other mention of this brother in the collection or in any records about John Newsom in the IU Archives.</p><p> Newsom attended Indiana University and graduated with his AB in 1891. While at Indiana he played both football and baseball and was a member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. After graduating from Indiana he attained his AM from Leland Stanford Jr. University in 1892 and then returned to IU where he was an instructor in Geology from 1894-1896. During this time he met his future wife, Adelaide Frances Perry, a student of Greek at Indiana University and a member of the Kappa Alpha Tao sorority. She had two brothers who are both mentioned in the correspondence of the collection; Oscar and Orville Perry. Her brothers were members of the same fraternity as Newsom, though he is at least five years their senior. Adelaide and John were married in Bloomington, IN on March 17, 1896. He stayed at Indiana University through 1899, becoming an assistant professor of geology in 1896. They had their first and only child, a son by the name of John Branner Newsom, some time shortly after this. While at Indiana he was also named treasurer of the Athletic Association for the 1897 school year. He was on leave during 1898-1899 and worked for these years as an assistant professor of geology at Leland Stanford Jr. University. He returned to Indiana and after inquiring about his future as a professor at the university decided to move to California to teach at Leland Stanford University and also to work towards his doctoral degree in geology, which he attained in 1901. He worked at Leland Stanford University until 1910, during which time he became professor of geology. He then spent the next fourteen years traveling the world doing professional exams of mining projects.</p><p> His geological and mining career started after he attained his AB from Indiana. The summer of 1891 he began a geological survey of Arkansas, which he completed in 1893. He went back to Arkansas in 1897 and examined the phosphate deposits there until 1899. During this time he was also involved in studying the principal mining regions in the central and western United States. He did work in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California during the summers of 1901-1904. He traveled to Alaska, Canada, and the Orient on several different occasions, eventually setting up a mining operation based out of Ipoh, near Singapore. Newsome co-authored two books; <title render="italic">Syllabus of Lectures on Economic Geology</title> and <title render="italic">The phosphate rocks of Arkansas</title>, both in collaboration with John Casper Branner. He also wrote an article that appeared in the American Geologist entitled, <title render="doublequote">The Red River Clinton Monoclines, Kansas</title>. He was a member of several organizations including The American Association for the Advancement of Science, the California Academic Society, the American Institution of Mining Engineers, the Mineral and Metallurgy Society of American Fellows, the Geological Society of America and the Geological Society of London.</p><p> Newsom died on October 24, 1928, of natural causes. He is buried in Bartholomew County, Indiana.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Arrangement</head>
<p>The collection is organized into two series: Correspondence and Personal papers.</p>  </arrangement>
  <scopecontent id="aspace_eeab18f2ea44de864c8c4409d4c4b778">
    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The John F. Newsom papers span 1894-1923 and are arranged into two series: Correspondence and Personal papers. </p><p> The first and largest series, Correspondence, spans the years 1894-1923. It consists primarily of correspondence between John and his wife, Adelaide during his trips away from home, but also includes a handful of letters from and to other family members, including their son, Banner; Adelaide's mother, Louise; and Oscar Perry, who was probably Adelaide's brother. The series also includes a letter press book of Newsom's outgoing correspondence spanning 1894-1898. The volume is in quite bad shape with the ink very faded or blurred on many of the pages.</p><p> The second series is Personal papers consisting of just a few items. The first is dated 1902 and is a passenger roster for the American Line Steamship. Both John Newsom and his wife appear on this list. Also included are a "Drawing of a Chinese mansion," presumably done by John F. Newsom and two small leather notebooks with finance information and other notes. There is one file from Newsom's work with the Geological Survey which includes receipts and a log book.</p>  </scopecontent>
