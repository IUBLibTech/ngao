    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>On 6 January 1942, less than a month after the United States entered World War II, the Administrative Council of Indiana University met to "consider enlarging itself for the deliberation and discussion of the program of the University during the war period." Twelve new representatives were added to create a 26 member council. This expanded Administrative Council was renamed the Administrative War Council. The original roster of members was comprised of: E. Ross Bartley, Ward G. Biddle, Herman T. Briscoe, Robert E. Cavanaugh, Thomas A. Cookson, William H. Crawford, Willis D. Gatch, Bernard C. Gavit, Fernandus Payne, Henry Lester Smith, Selatie E. Stout, Arthur M. Weimer, Robert L. Sanders, Raymond L. Shoemaker, Kate H. Mueller, Clarence E. Edmondson, Edward E. Edwards, Joseph A. Franklin, Frank R. Elliott, Earle C. "Billy" Hayes, Edwin H. Sutherland, Willard W. Patty, Oliver P. Field, Albert L. Kohlmeier, Ralph E. Cleland, and Herman B Wells. </p><p> Edward Everett Edwards was the secretary of the Administrative War Council from its inception until 30 April 1942. E. Ross Bartley served as acting secretary between 10 June and 1 July 1942 before being replaced by Robert T. Ittner, who served as secretary for the remainder of the council's existence.</p><p> The council began an intensive series of meetings, gathering daily from 7-14 January 1942, addressing immediate changes to be made at Indiana University in order to accommodate the war effort. These changes were compiled into a report and presented to the entire faculty on 15 January 1942. The largest change implemented was the introduction of a third semester during the summer. This additional semester facilitated an accelerated program that would allow students to quickly acquire the education and specialized training necessary to wage the war.</p><p> Additional changes included:</p>    <list type="ordered">
      <item>• limiting faculty leaves of absence to an emergency basis only</item>
      <item>• relaxing admissions requirements</item>
      <item>• allowing students with only three years of high school to enter the university</item>
      <item>• offering military service credit for students called to fight mid-semester</item>
      <item>• creating wartime scholarships for the fields in which trained professionals were most needed</item>
      <item>• revising and concentrating curriculum for wartime needs</item>
      <item>• establishing a special series of lectures, courses, reading lists, and films addressing "War Aims," in order to keep students informed</item>
      <item>• creating National Defense and Military training classes to prepare students for active military service</item>
      <item>• increasing physical education requirements for all students, including mandatory training in the areas of nursing and first aid for all female students</item>
      <item>• implementing an economic conservation plan to use physical plant and human resources more effectively</item>
      <item>• heightening communication to the student body from the president of the university and from the Administrative War Council to keep students abreast of changes and unified in the war effort</item>
    </list>
<p>The Administrative War Council also met with the Student War Council on 21 January 1942 to discuss these changes with students.</p><p> Over the course of the next three years, the council met periodically to address specific implementation of the changes outlined in their original report. By 18 October 1944, the minutes mentioned a "Postwar Planning Committee" whose attentions are devoted to making the transition away from wartime needs to the general higher education goals of Indiana University. The council began to consider how the heightened physical education requirements would change after the war and if and how soldiers returning to student life would be given credit for their military service. On 9 May 1945, with 13 members in absentia, including President Wells, the council had its final meeting to hear a report on the Military Service Credit.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The collection contains the original minutes of the Administrative War Council, which includes numerous appended documents and several reports. Key issues covered in the minutes include the addition of a third semester over the summer to accelerate studies and graduate war-ready students with the creation of specialized programming, policies and curriculum addressing war issues. Each meeting's minutes are signed by the secretary who reported them. The minutes span from the Council's creation on 6 January 1942 to its last meeting on 9 May 1945. They are arranged chronologically.</p><p> A brief Administrative files series contains a roster of the Administrative War Council's members, charting their attendance at meetings from 18 Oct. 1944 to the council's last meeting on 9 May 1945, and a draft of the initial report to the Indiana University faculty from 15 January 1942. A final copy of this report is included in the minutes. These two files are arranged chronologically.</p>  </scopecontent>
