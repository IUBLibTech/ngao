<p>William W. Spencer, born October 7, 1851, in Indiana, received a B.S. from Indiana University in 1875 and graduated from the Department of Law in 1877. As a student, Spencer participated in the University Circuit Moot Court. After receiving his degree, he moved to Marion County, Indiana, where he served as a precinct committeeman and ward chairman. He was active in the Marion County Democratic Central Committee from 1881-1892, serving as both the secretary and later as the chairman. In both 1904 and 1908, he was chosen as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention. He was elected member of the Indiana House of Representatives from Marion County in 1911 and served until 1914, participating as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Following his time in the General Assembly, he served as a commissioner on the state Board of Elections from 1918-1938. He died December 9, 1938 in Indianapolis.</p><p> Source: Shepherd, Rebecca A.
