    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>The American Veterans Committee (1943-2008) was formed in 1943 as a liberal veteran's organization and served as an alternative to conservative veterans groups, such as the American Legion. The organization enjoyed high rates of membership during the mid-1940s, but membership dropped drastically as the AVC responded to the Second Red Scare and purged its ranks of communist members. The AVC supported and promoted political issues such as Civil Rights, civil liberties, and increased subsistence and housing support for veterans. Over time, the organization expanded its focus to include serving as a military watchdog and aiding veterans of subsequent wars as well as underserved female veterans. The AVC disbanded in 2008 due to dwindling membership.</p><p> The Bloomington, Indiana chapter consisted predominantly of veterans who were attending Indiana University because of the G.I. Bill. History Professor Charles Leonard Lundin served as the organization's faculty sponsor. The chapter focused largely on issues in the local community, such as working to end racial discrimination. The Bloomington chapter appears to have disbanded around 1949.</p>  </bioghist>
