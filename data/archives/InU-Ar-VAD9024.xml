    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>William T. Morgan was born May 19, 1883 in Dell Roy, Ohio. He received his bachelor's degree from Ohio University in 1909 and served various teaching and administrative roles in a number of schools throughout Ohio. After earning his master's in history from Harvard in 1910, he served as an instructor in government at Iowa State Teachers College before pursuing and earning his Ph.D. in history from Yale University in 1916. He taught for three years at Columbia University and then joined the history faculty at Indiana University in 1919, where he ultimately remained until his death in 1946. He also served as an instructor at Ohio University, Boston University, Duke University, State University of Iowa, and the University of Michigan during summer sessions.</p><p> Morgan specialized in English history but had an educational background in pedagogy and frequently examined and wrote about pressing concerns in education in addition to and in association with his historical research. Of his numerous publications in history, political science, and education, Morgan is best known for his five-volume Bibliography of British History, 1700-1715, with a particular focus on the reign of Queen Anne, published between 1934-1942. He also published in the Political Science Quarterly, the South Atlantic Quarterly, the Contemporary Review, the American Historical Review, and the Journal of Modern History. He spent a considerable time abroad, especially in England, as part of his research, spending the summers of 1915, 1933, and 1936 and the academic years of 1923-1924 and 1929-1930 overseas.</p><p> Among the honors Morgan received during his career were membership in the Royal Historical Society and receipt of the Herbert Baxter Adams Prize from the American Historical Association. Morgan passed away on June 9, 1946.</p>  </bioghist>
