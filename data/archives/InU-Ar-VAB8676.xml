    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Will T. Hale was born in Mobile, Alabama in 1880 to Foster Kirksey and Nettie Pope Hale. Developing an early appreciation for English literature, he graduated from his local high school in 1898 and then began his collegiate education by first attending Vanderbilt University where he earned his A.B. and A.M. degrees in 1902. He then proceeded to Yale University where he graduated with his Bachelors from the School of Divinity in 1905. After this, he began his teaching career when he became a professor of History and English at Morrisville College in Montana for a short period before moving on to the University of Texas, where he was an instructor of English from 1907-1910. Soon after, he obtained his Masters degree in English at Columbia University and graduated in 1912. He returned to Yale for his Ph.D., and graduated in 1914. His career at Indiana University began as an English instructor in 1913 and in 1918, he became an assistant professor. In 1924, he was promoted to associate professor and in 1929, he became a full professor. During his career, he specialized in Victorian poetry and Bible literature. He published and edited several books about popular authors, such as BronteĚ and Milton. He was also active in the fraternity Phi Gamma Delta, which he joined during his college years and as a faculty member, he aided the house in events and fundraising. Though only barely mentioned in biographical material, it is said he regularly helped young men complete college through monetary grants and offering room and board at his house.</p><p>  During his tenure at IU, Hale was regularly awarded the Brown Derby award, which was given to the most popular professor of the year. He was a member of the American Association of University Professors and the Modern Languages Association of America and the Faculty Club at IU. On a more personal level, he established the Browning Club of Indiana University and was a Mason for many years. He retired on July 1, 1950 but stayed active in the community as well as IU until his death in 1967, on February 5th.</p>  </bioghist>
