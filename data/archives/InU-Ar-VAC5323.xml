    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>The Indiana University chapter of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) was founded in 1964 and remained active until 1969 when the national organization disbanded. SDS was a nationwide organization primarily composed of, created, and directed by college students. This organization was part of the New Left political movement of the 1960s and its members protested the Vietnam War, were in favor of the Civil Rights Movement, and advocated free speech on university campuses.</p><p> The Indiana University chapter was small, reporting 40 members in 1967, but active and outspoken. They gathered much attention in the <title render="italic">Indiana Daily Student</title> and other local press through their protests and actions against the University Administration. They disliked the power held by the Board of Trustees and thought that the University Administration was too involved in regulating students' daily lives. The organization's primary actions included holding protests, distributing pamphlets and publications encouraging anti-war, anti-government, and anti-establishment sentiments, and working to increase group membership and awareness of these issues. In 1965, the group tried to obstruct the draft process by distributing forms and publishing booklets instructing students on how to apply for conscientious objector status, which was a federal offense at the time.</p><p> Their most public act towards the university was the submission of a document to President Elvis Stahr in 1968 demanding that IU cease its support of the ROTC program, disallow military presence on campus, and cease any funding, training, or research support for the military. They also wanted IU to stop sending police to student protests, clearly label administrators at protest events, and to ban campus police from carrying weapons that may be used against protestors. All of their demands were denied by the President's Office, and their statements also garnered a lengthy response from former President Herman B Wells, which was published in the <title render="italic">Indiana Daily Student.</title></p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The newsletters in this collection were created as a forum for people in the IU community to express their opinions, comments, and ideas about the New Left political movement. They were written, published, and distributed by student volunteers.</p><p> The newsletters contain editorials, speeches, requests for volunteers for membership activities, relevant reading lists and bibliographies, and information about upcoming protests, community events, and projects sponsored by SDS. This organization had its own Civil Rights Committee, and newsletter topics covered include writings about the Civil Rights Movement, support for SNCC, the March on Washington, and actions against the KKK. They also include speeches and writings from the national SDS organization, updates about issues surrounding the Vietnam War, opinions on current political events in Washington, D.C., and complaints against government or university policies.</p><p> The newsletters also discuss issues relevant to IU, such as plans to form a community outreach program for low-income areas of Bloomington, a debate over whether or not participation at demonstrations would harm or help SDS's reputation on campus, and an article about the role of women in SDS, an issue which later gained nationwide attention and helped spawn the Women's Liberation Movement of the 1960s.</p><p> The first two newsletters also contain issues of <title render="italic">I.F. Stone's Weekly.</title></p>  </scopecontent>
