    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>The History Club was started during the Fall Semester 1902 at Indiana University. This organization was conceived of with the purpose to promote historical research, method of historical study and teaching, and to cultivate mutual interest in historical study. At one point the club was the largest departmental organization on the Bloomington campus. The organizational structure of the History Club was as follows: a President, a Vice President, and a Secretary-Treasurer. An Executive Committee with the club's Vice President as Chairman and two other members appointed by the President were responsible for preparing the club's programs and notifying members of their duties. At first, membership was restricted to undergraduates majoring in history with a minimum of 30 credit hours completed in their major. Membership was also open to professors in the History department as well as other individuals with special historical interests. On February 23, 1911, the club's constitution was amended to allow membership for graduate students as well as undergraduates having completed only 20 credit hours in the history major. </p><p> The History Club met every 2 weeks at faculty homes, university buildings, or other Bloomington locations. At the meetings members presented papers and were called upon to lead discussions. Aside from serious scholarly discourse, the club also enjoyed social activities including a mysterious game they often played at their monthly meetings called "Woodburn's Delight." The club sponsored many scholarly and social activities beyond their meetings, such as the celebration of Benjamin Franklin's 200th birthday on January 21, 1906. </p><p> In 1918, the club was renamed the History and Political Science Club, and a new constitution was written in 1922-1923. The History and Political Science Club was very similar to the History Club with the exception that membership was open to faculty, seniors, and graduate students in the Political Science department. </p><p> Since the History and Political Science Club was mainly an undergraduate organization, the Graduate History Club was formed on October 6, 1938. Membership in this scholarly club was open to graduate students pursuing history degrees as well as faculty. Due to the minimal organization of the club, the only offices created were those of President and Secretary-Treasurer; Mr. Henrickson being elected as the club's first President and Miss Bay elected to the position of Secretary-Treasurer. </p><p> One of the first committees appointed by the President of the Graduate History Club was the Program Committee which was comprised of 3 members who were responsible for considering the topics suggested for the group to discuss relating to history and current issues. Later committees appointed by the President were the News-Letter committee, Ways and Means Banquet Committee, and the Nominating Committee. The News-Letter committee resulted from the club's desire to continue contact with Indiana graduates now working in history related fields. </p><p> In the early years of the Graduate History Club, meetings were held on a monthly schedule most of which took place at the homes of faculty and later on university property, sometimes in connection with the meetings of the undergraduate History and Political Science Club. During these meetings the club entertained presentations of topics by faculty and other scholarly researchers as well as presented their own papers and criticisms of published works. </p><p> On October 29, 1942, after the death of I.U. professor Logan Esarey, the Graduate History Club officially adopted and continued their scholarly pursuits as the "Logan Esarey History Club" in tribute of the first man to earn a Ph.D. in History from I.U.</p>  </bioghist>
