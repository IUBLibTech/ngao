    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Dr. Gerardo M. Gonzalez is Dean Emeritus and Professor of Educational Leadership and Policy Studies at the Indiana University School of Education.</p><p> Gonzalez was born on September 24, 1950 in Placetas, Cuba. Gonzalez, his parents, and his sister Maritza immigrated to the United States as refugees from Cuba in February 1962, three years into Fidel Castro's rule, when Gonzalez was eleven years old. The first in his family to graduate from college, he went on to become a prominent academic leader in the United States.</p><p> After starting out at Miami Dade Junior College, Gonzalez received his B.A. degree in psychology in 1973 and his Ph.D. in counseling and higher education administration in 1978, both from the University of Florida. He came to Indiana University after serving as the interim dean of the College of Education at the University of Florida in Gainesville, where he was also a professor and chair of the Department of Counselor Education and the associate dean for Administration and Finance.</p><p> Gonzalez served as dean of the IU School of Education from 2000-2015, directing administrative and budgetary activities and providing academic oversight to education programs on six regional campuses of Indiana University. Upon his retirement from the deanship in 2015, Indiana University President Michael McRobbie presented Gonzalez with the President's Medal for Excellence.</p><p> A recognized expert on drug and alcohol education, in 1977 Gonzalez founded Boost Alcohol Consciousness Concerning the Health of University Students (BACCHUS), the nation's largest peer-based collegiate organization for the prevention of alcohol abuse.</p><p> Gonzalez is also active in multicultural counseling and education issues, and has published scholarly works on the Cuban-American experience and Latino educational concerns. His memoir <title render="italic">A Cuban Refugee's Journey to the American Dream: The Power of Education</title> was published by IU Press in August 2018.</p>  </bioghist>
