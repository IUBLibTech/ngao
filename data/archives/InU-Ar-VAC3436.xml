    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>At the time of transfer, Deborah Hutton, ISIS project coordinator from 1998-2006, provided this description of the ISIS project:</p><p> <emph render="bold">What is ISIS:</emph></p><p> The project ISIS was started in about 1995 by then Dean of International Programs (OIP) Patrick O'Meara and then Dean of the School of Education (SOE) Howard Mehlinger, and is ongoing today. Originally ISIS stood for "International Studies for Indiana Schools," when Indiana schools were all that it served, but some years later was changed to "International Studies In Schools", since it now serves schools (and a few other audiences) right across the country.</p><p> <emph render="bold">What does ISIS do:</emph></p><p><emph render="italic">International Studies In Schools</emph> (ISIS) is an innovative and award-winning distance learning program which uses interactive video technology (IAV) to connect K-12 schools and community groups across the U.S. with Indiana University international students, scholars, and specialists. With no expensive travel abroad needed, the world is brought right into the classroom.</p><p> <emph render="bold">Brief history to date:</emph></p><p> In the mid-1990s, there was a confluence of events to make this project possible:</p><p> a) Howard Mehlinger was completing the construction of the new SOE, with integrated technologies, including videoconferencing capabilities, and partner AT&amp;T;</p><p> b) Patrick O'Meara, formerly director of the Title VI funded African Studies Program, was taking over as Dean, OIP, where he oversaw 4,000+ international students;</p><p> c) Title VI funding grants were now requiring outreach to K-12 audiences;</p><p> d) IUB was steadily adding to its number of Title VI area studies centers which had to do that outreach and which were looking for economies of scale to help all of them deliver outreach;</p><p> e) AT&amp;T in Indiana lost a court case and owed every Indiana taxpayer a very small amount of money ($30,000 in total). Instead, AT&amp;T proposed that they start a non-profit organization with that money, then called <emph render="italic">Vision Athena,</emph> to facilitate getting high fiber cable to and IAV equipment into public schools and organize distance learning programming for the schools via IAV.</p><p> With grants, among others, from Vision Athena and the Indiana Humanities Council, ISIS became a "Content Provider" of any international topic requested by a K-12 teacher for her/his class, all for free. Vision Athena morphed a few times and is now called CILC or Center for Interactive Learning and Collaboration. CILC is still located in Indianapolis and continues to connect content providers with audiences, mostly schools, around the world.</p><p> <emph render="bold">Websites:</emph></p><p> ISIS: <extref xlink:href="http://www.indiana.edu/~isis/">http://www.indiana.edu/~isis/</extref> </p><p> CILC: <extref xlink:href="http://www.cilc.org/">http://www.cilc.org/</extref> </p><p> <emph render="bold">Awards:</emph></p><p> 2001 DIAL Consortium's <emph render="italic">International Distance Learning Programming Award</emph> </p><p> Recipient: International Studies for Indiana Schools [interactive video] Project, for two original series</p><p> 2002 American Council on Education's <emph render="italic">Promising Practices: Spotlighting Excellence in Comprehensive Internationalization</emph> Highlighted multiple IUB outreach projects, including ISIS</p><p> 2005 Goldman Sachs Foundation &amp; Asia Society's <emph render="italic">Excellence in International Education Prize</emph> for Higher Education Highlighted three IUB centers, which collaborated on multiple outreach projects, including ISIS</p><p> 2009-2010 Center for Interactive Learning and Collaboration's <emph render="italic">Pinnacle Award, Honorable Mention</emph> </p><p> In recognition of outstanding videoconferencing programs</p><p> <emph render="bold">Partners (over time):</emph></p><p> • IU Office of International Programs (OIP), now Office of the Vice President of International Affairs (OVPIA)</p><p> • IU School of Education, Center for Research on Learning and Technology (CRLT) (ended)</p><p> • IU Title VI &amp; other international centers:</p><p> > African Studies Program</p><p> > Center for Latin American &amp; Caribbean Studies</p><p> > Center for the Study of Global Change</p><p> > Center for the Study of the Middle East</p><p> > East Asian Studies Center</p><p> > European Union Center</p><p> > Germanic Studies</p><p> > India Studies Program</p><p> > Inner Asian &amp; Uralic National Resource Center</p><p> > Islamic Studies Program</p><p> > Mathers Museum of World Cultures</p><p> > Russian &amp; East European Institute</p><p> > West European Studies Center</p><p> • Vision Athena, now Center for Interactive Learning and Collaboration's (CILC)</p><p> <emph render="bold">If you have questions, please contact:</emph> Deb Hutton, Assistant Director (former ISIS Program Coordinator, 1998-2006, approx..)

<p>At this time, these records have not been processed by the Archives and are in the order in which they were received from Hutton in 2012. Brief descriptions of box contents have been provided below. According to Hutton, "The boxes include the files of ISIS from its beginnings in 1995 through the mid-2000s when all files became digital. As well, the boxes contain the video tapes which recorded many of the programs, until videotaping became outdated and the tapes unavailable."</p>  </scopecontent>
