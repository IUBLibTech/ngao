    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>The Indiana College Association was first formed as a supplemental organization to the Indiana State Teachers Association in 1867 but became a part of the ISTA in 1874. In 1877 it was recreated as a supplemental organization during the annual meeting of the ISTA in Indianapolis when college administrators and professors from throughout the state recognized the continued need for the organization in order to focus specifically on management and instruction issues related to higher education. Indiana University was one of the founding institutions and early active members from IU included President Lemuel Moss and Professors Amzi Atwater, G. W. Hoss and O. B. Clark.</p><p> From 1877 to 1906, the Indiana College Association met annually in Indianapolis in late December on the days preceding the ISTA general meeting. In May 1906, after increasing decline in interest in and attendance at the annual meetings, a committee was established to determine the future of the association. At the annual meeting in December 1906 the committee reported on the continued need for the association and offered recommendations for its improvement. New officers were also elected at this meeting; however, it is not known whether the Association continued or not as the minutes transferred to the Archives end with that meeting.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Indiana College Association records were transferred to the archives in May 1939 by Ernest Hiram Lindley and consist of files created by the association from 1877 to 1906. Included in the collection are copies of the association's annual meeting addresses and proceedings for the years 1880, 1881, 1883, and 1892 through 1894. These addresses and proceedings contain the full-text of presentations and in some cases also provide details of the subsequent discussions. A records book contains the association's constitution and by-laws, history, and annual meeting minutes from 1877 to 1906, as well as lists of the association's founding institutions, original members, officers, and publications.</p>  </scopecontent>
