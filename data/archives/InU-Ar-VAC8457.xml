    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>The Sociology Club of Indiana University was created on November 10, 1936. The purpose of the club was to establish an organization for interacting with fellow students and instructors and to instill a deeper insight and a more vital interest in sociology. Dr. Edwin H. Sutherland, Professor of Sociology presided over the club from the beginning. Membership in the club was first approved for all Juniors and Seniors majoring in Sociology, and at a later date to all others who applied and were voted in by a majority of members attending meetings. All Sociology faculty were honorary members of the club. The Club's last meeting was held on March 14, 1940, where there were too few undergraduates to elect the following year's officers.</p>  </bioghist>
