    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>The Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center (JPMC) (originally known as the Basic Medical Sciences Institute (BMSI)) is located at the University of Karachi in Karachi, Pakistan. This project was administered by the Office of the Dean of Research and Advanced Studies and funded through a grant from the International Cooperation Administration (ICA), which merged with the US Agency for International Development (USAID) in 1961. The purpose of this project was to educate and train teachers in the fields of medical science through the development of a postgraduate Master of Science degree program with the intent that individuals serve as faculty members at medical colleges throughout Pakistan. It was hoped that this would increase the quality and quantity of medical education in Pakistan. Additional training courses in shop, laboratory, research, and library science in the medical field were also developed. The contract began in 1957 and ended in 1966, with the first students admitted to the institute in 1959.</p><p> Dr. Paul A. Nicoll served as the initial Chief of Party, followed by Dr. Harold Margulies and Dr. Sherman A. Minton, Jr. Many other faculty members served as instructors and advisors throughout the course of the project in the fields of pharmacology, biochemistry, anatomy, microbiology, and pathology. Dr. William Hugh Headlee from the Indianapolis campus was Contract Coordinator for the project. At the beginning of the project, John Ashton, Vice-President for Graduate Development and Dean of the Graduate School, served as the overseeing agent from Indiana University-Bloomington. In 1965, Lynne Merritt took over Ashton's position, and the department's title was changed to the Office of Research and Advanced Studies. This office oversaw several international programs, including those previously associated with Ashton's office.</p><p> The JPMC was designed to offer postgraduate education in anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology, pathology, pharmacology, and physiology to incumbent or potential medical college teachers in Pakistan. In addition to developing an academic curriculum and degree program in Pakistan, 21 Pakistani students, 19 of whom attended Indiana University, were sent to the U.S. to continue their education in more advanced specialties. The project also focused on building the university library's collections in basic medical sciences and within the clinical specialties available at the university. Library staff received training in library science, and the library was reorganized and its practices updated, making it the premiere research and reference library in Pakistan.</p><p> All of the Indiana University project members left Karachi by the end of 1965, but the contract was extended until March 1966 due to armed conflict between India and Pakistan that caused delays in the final phases of the project. Final evaluations and reports were completed in 1967.</p><p> Overall, the project was deemed successful. In addition to the Master of Science degree, a clinical training program, a Bachelor of Science degree program in medical technology, and a Ph.D. program in basic medical sciences were planned and being implemented at the contract's close. Other accomplishments included the remodeling of campus buildings and the purchase and installation of equipment and supplies.</p>  </bioghist>
