    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>William Tinsley was an Irish architect known for his design of institutional buildings in Indiana and Ohio and best-known locally for his design of the First University Building (1855) on Indiana University Bloomington's original campus at Seminary Square.</p><p> Tinsley was born on February 7, 1804 in Clonmel, Ireland, where he was a diocesan architect in both public and private sectors. Tinsley migrated to the United States with his family in 1851, first living in Cincinnati before moving to Indianapolis in 1853. His work includes college buildings, courthouses, and churches; some examples are the Center Hall at Wabash College, Bascom Hall at the University of Wisconsin, Ascension Hall at Kenyon College, Institution for the Education of the Blind at Columbus, Ohio, Calvary Church at Cincinnati, North Western Christian University (later Butler University), and Christ Church on Monument Circle, Indianapolis. William Tinsley died on June 14, 1885.</p><p> Tinsley was married three times, and two children from his second marriage to Lucy McCarthy, Charles and Harvey, also write in the journal. Charles was born in 1832 and Harvey in 1842.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The collection consists of one journal written in by William Tinsley and his two sons, Charles and Harvey R. All three discuss their childhoods, family life, educations, and travels in detail. There are also letters and newspaper clippings placed into the journal that detail family obituaries, letters of recommendation for the elder Tinsley's travel to the United States.</p><p> His two sons, Charles Tinsley (1832-?), and Harvey R. Tinsley (26 May 1842-?), also used the journal to detail parts of their lives, mostly auto-biographical and biographical information. Charles wrote from 1853 to 1907, discussing biographical information, and also to journal his day-to-day life, his contribution to his father's life, and his work with religion in Indiana. Harvey discusses biographical information, the on goings of his family life, and genealogy.</p><p> There is a detailed genealogy of both the Tinsley and McCarthy (completed by Charles in 1899) families in the journal, as well as marginal notes made by different, unnamed members of the family throughout.</p>  </scopecontent>
