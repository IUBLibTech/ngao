    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>The <emph render="italic">Crimson Bull</emph> was a humor magazine founded by students at Indiana University in 1920. Many of the founders were members of the IU chapter of Sigma Delta Chi, a professional journalistic fraternity, and/or were involved in other campus publications, including the <emph render="italic">Indiana Daily Student</emph> (IDS) and the <emph render="italic">Arbutus</emph> (yearbook). The fraternity also funded the magazine, supplementing income from subscriptions and advertisements.</p><p> The first issue of the <emph render="italic">Crimson Bull</emph> was printed in October 1920 under the leadership of Elmer W. Sherwood, editor-in-chief. The magazine satirized aspects of university life through comedic sketches, cartoons, articles, and editorials, and the editors solicited contributions from IU students through announcements published in the IDS. The editors released two more issues in 1920, but the <emph render="italic">Crimson Bull</emph> officially ceased publication sometime in 1921, apparently from a continued shortage of funding, subscriptions, and creative contributions from the student body. Calls for contributors that appeared in the IDS indicate that issues were planned for February, March, and May 1921, although it is unclear whether any of these were officially published. A brief articles appearing in the IDS in 1922 mentions that the <emph render="italic">Crimson Bull</emph> had three editors during a total run of four issues.</p><p> In 1947, Lawrence Wheeler, a journalist, Executive Director of the Indiana University Foundation, and original member of the 1920 <emph render="italic">Crimson Bull</emph> student editorial board, served as faculty advisor to a new version of the <emph render="italic">Crimson Bull</emph>, also a student-run humor magazine, which ran from 1947-1956.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>This collection consists of the second and third issues of the <emph render="italic">Crimson Bull</emph> (1920), as well as cover art for the February 1921 issue, which may or may not have been published.</p><p> While lacking the very first issue, the second and third issues evidence the first efforts to incorporate a broader university-wide collaboration of artists, writers, and humorists to reflect, critique, and poke fun at certain issues and "hot topics" concerning campus life, administration, and policy.</p><p> An overarching theme governs each issue's content. The second issue, titled "The Purdue Number," focuses much of its content on Indiana University's long-standing rivalry with Purdue University. The third issue, "The Rhinie Number," covers the freshman experience adjusting to college life at Indiana University.</p>  </scopecontent>
