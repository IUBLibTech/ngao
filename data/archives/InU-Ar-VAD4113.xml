He is responsible for creating many of the structures that define Indiana University as well as many residential buildings in the surrounding city. The Student Building, Wylie Hall, and Kirkwood Observatory were all designed by Nichols. This collection is comprised solely of a scrapbook documenting his work (and that of his firm, Nichols &amp; Sons Architects) between the years 1893-1908.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>John L. Nichols (1859-1929), a proud native of Bloomington, Indiana, was one of its premiere architects. The son of Hiram J. Nichols, an early settler and land surveyor of Bloomington, and Rebecca M. (Rogers) Nichols, he was one of six children. He is often associated with his brothers, Leo M. Nichols, who owned a successful clothing business in Indianapolis, and Mort Nichols, who joined him in making the firm a partnership in 1913. </p><p> Since early adulthood, the path to become an architect seemed inevitable. Nichols worked with his father in a construction and architectural firm and even sold architectural supplies at one point. In 1886 he worked as a draftsman and supervising architect for the firm F.E. Edbrooke &amp; Company in Denver. In 1893, his career path took a sharp turn. When Nichols was thirty-four years old, a financial panic struck the United States, marked by a failing railroad line and a series of bank failures that shook the nation's confidence. After the Panic of 1893, construction work was scarce, so Nichols resolved to work wherever it could be found. Two years later, he returned to Bloomington and started J.L. Nichols, Architect, his own architectural business that drafted a majority of residential homes as well as more notable Bloomington structures still visible today including the Princess Theatre (1913, 1923), the Von Lee Theatre (1928), and the Kirkwood Observatory (1900). </p><p> In his personal life Nichols was married three times: first to Jennie Sare (divorced in 1895), Anna Keeler (married in 1897), and finally Mabel Dunn (1903), the daughter of Samuel Grundy Dunn. He was also a member of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, Independent Order of Red Men, and the Court of Honor, and the Knights of Pythias.</p>  </bioghist>
