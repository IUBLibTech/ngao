    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Clarence Joseph Bulleit (later Bulliet) was born on March 16, 1883. During World War I he changed the spelling of his last name to Bulliet to avoid any connection to Germany. He grew up in Corydon, Indiana, and went on to study at Indiana University. While at the University, he was a writer for the Daily Student and became editor in chief in 1904. He often wrote poems that were published in the paper. After graduating in 1904, he pursued a career in journalism in Indianapolis, Indiana. Eventually he became a press agent for Robert Mantell, who was the Head of the Shakespearean Touring Theater Company. This job involved touring the United States and Canada, which he did for a period of nine years. One year was spent as a regional "advance man," or publicist, which involved traveling ahead of the company to promote the silent film, The Birth of a Nation, released in 1915. He briefly returned to his career in journalism in Louisville, Kentucky, until relocating shortly after to Chicago, Illinois, to work as an editor of the Magazine of the Art World, a weekly journal published by the Chicago Evening Post (later The Chicago Daily News in 1932). </p><p> Bulliet played a key role in popularizing modern art in the Midwestern United States and over the course of his career he published six books on the subject. Bulliet married his first wife, artist Katherine Adams, on October 22, 1905. They had one son named Leander Jackson. After Katherine's death in 1946, Bulliet remarried but died shortly thereafter, in 1952.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The collection consists entirely of letters written by Bulliet to fiancee Katherine Adams while he was a student at Indiana University. The letters span the period from October of 1902 through December of 1904. Many of the letters include clippings of Bulliet's poems that were published in the Daily Student, the IU student newspaper, as well as other items such as a ribbon (or badge) from a "Mock Democratic Election," and a card from a men's clothing company. Much of what Bulliet wrote was about everyday life and life at the University.</p><p> Besides coursework, campus visitors and events, Bulliet wrote of his experiences with different student elections, noting that certain fraternities on campus, as well as the sophomore class at the time he was a freshmen, tried to sabotage elections. In one of his letters, he wrote about his apprehension in running for Editor-in-Chief of the Daily Student, saying that he was nominated and did not want to run. Campus sporting events and pranks were other topics about which Bulliet wrote. He noted the brutality of football games and writes regularly about the strife and scraps between the freshmen and sophomore classes, including "The Big Freshmen/Sophomore Scrap" that took place February 23, 1904, in which the freshmen president was kidnapped by sophomores.</p>  </scopecontent>
