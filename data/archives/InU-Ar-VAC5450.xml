    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>An all-female social and campus service organization, the Pleiades was founded on Indiana University Bloomington's campus on September 24, 1921. It was created by two members each of Delta Gamma, Kappa Kappa Gamma, and Kappa Alpha Theta. The group initially formed for organizing various social events but became an established organization on campus after their success. Membership was limited to 25 women who led a prominent and active life at the university. The name "Pleiades" come from the Greek legend surrounding the daughters of Atlas and Pleione. The symbol of the group was a winged Earth, representing time eternal, celestialness and universality. Six stars are marked on the Earth to represent six of the seven Pleiads of mythology. The seventh Pleiad is considered lost. Alternately, in the group pledge it is stated that the six stars represent the six original founders. Also, Pleiades is derived from the Greek word "to sail" and that members of Pleiades, like the stars themselves, must sail above the petty trivial things which are unpleasant in everyday life. The colors of the group were: bronze, from Delta Gamma; blue, from Kappa Kappa Gamma; and black, from Kappa Alpha Theta, representing sincerity, friendliness, and cooperation.</p><p> The Pleiades motto in the 1924 Arbutus yearbook reads, "We can't take all the girls in school, so we only take the best."</p><p> One of the last mentions of the Pleiades as a university group was found in the 1974 Arbutus yearbook.</p>  </bioghist>
