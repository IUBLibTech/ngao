    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>When Mrs. Ridenour's son, W. W. Ridenour, donated these items to the archives, he included this writeup about his mother and the people represented in the diary and scrapbooks:</p><p> Mildred Valeda Daum, IU 1922, was born in Evansville, April 2, 1900. Her parents were Charles and Elizabeth Daum. Their home was at 420 Washington Ave. (When Mildred lived there it was 510 Washington Ave.) Mildred graduated from Evansville High School in 1918, with the last class to graduate from Evansville H.S. She attended Lindenwood College 1918-1919 and began at Indiana University in 1919, and lived in Alpha Hall.</p><p> After her graduation from IU Mildred was at home for a year and in the fall of 1923 she began as an English teacher in Petersburg High School. Another beginning teacher at Petersburg HS at that time was W.W. Ridenour from Mount Vernon. From 1924 to 1926 Mildred was an English teacher at Central high School, Evansville. In June 1926 Mildred Daum and W.W. Ridenour were married. They lived in Petersburg and Fort Wayne and Bluffton. From 1930 to 1938 they lived in Seymour. From 1938 for the rest of their lives they lived in New Albany and neighboring Clarksville. They had two sons, W.W. Ridenour, Jr. IU class of 1950, now of Oxford, Ohio and Charles J. Ridenour, Sellersburg, Indiana. MDR died 4-13-1997.</p><p> About some of the people in the diary</p><p> Helen Sheridan and Brownie Rea, Anna Brown Rea were classmates in Evansville High School.</p><p> Jinnie and also Jinny is Eugenia Roth of Boonville. She went to a women's college in the eastern part of the U.S. She and Audrey Bolton of Dorchester, Mass., a classmate at that college came to Indiana University for year. I think that was their version of the junior year abroad. They lived in Alpha Hall.</p><p> Gertrude Wollenberger was my Mother's dearest girlhood friend.</p><p> Marjorie Buchanan and her mother was a widow, of Sumner, Illinois, west of Vincennes, moved to Evansville so that Marjorie could go to high school in a city. Marjorie was a year behind my mother in school but they became strong friends and remained friends for the rest of their lives.</p><p> Aunt Mamie and Uncle Charlie Lutz were my grandparents' closest friends. Carl Lutz was their only child. About 1950 Carl Lutz and Marjorie Buchanan were married. Both had been married before.</p><p> Doris Groan married William D. Thornbury, Professor of Geology at IU.</p><p> Wilbur Dunkel was the son of J. Ambrose Dunkel, the minister of Tabernacle Presbyterian Church, Indianapolis.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>This small collection consists entirely of Mrs. Ridenour's diary and two scrapbooks, which primarily date from her time as a student at Indiana University. The diary is "A Line a Day" and spans January 1, 1920 through the beginning of 1924. Ridenour wrote a short entry most days and many entries talk about her social plans, e.g., fraternity and sorority activities (she was in Pi Beta Phi), hanging out at the Book Nook, and her many dates.</p><p> The two scrapbooks span 1919-1923 and contain pictures of her sorority and fraternity friends and houses – including a few construction shots of the Pi Phi house – dance cards and programs, newspaper clippings, and small notes. These are housed separately. Please contact the Archives Photographs Curator for further information and access.</p>  </scopecontent>
