<p>Carolyn Judge Fink attended Indiana University beginning in <date normal="1948">1948</date>, graduating in <date normal="1952">1952</date> with her bachelor's degree. Her husband, John Benson Fink, a veteran of World War II, had come to IU for his doctorate in Biology, so Carolyn joined him, working when she was not in classes. John graduated in <date normal="1955">1955</date>. While at IU, the couple lived first in married students' housing, which was converted army barracks, then moved into a trailer at Hillcrest Trailer Court, and finally to a new apartment at Hoosier Court Annex.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The memoir covers all aspects of Fink's life as a student and student's wife at IU in the post-World War II era. Carolyn and her husband, John, lived first in married students' dormitories, then in the Hillcrest Trailer Court, and finally at Hoosier Court Annex. Many of the stories tell about the couple's experiences in their home: dealing with shared bathrooms, pet cats, a trailer fire, someone spying on others' wives in their trailers, the heater breaking down on a -14 degree night, cockroach infestation. Early in the days of the trailer park, there was some question about whether the area fell within or without the Bloomington city limits. In order to avoid paying higher in-town taxes, the trailer residents took the opportunity left by shoddy records to draw the town line where it was most convenient to them.</p><p>  Fink's other stories relate to trying to cook on a budget, and making some mistakes along the way: eating cow brains, mistaking a goose for a duck, wormy fish filets, John requiring Carolyn to finish her Limburger cheese in the bathroom.</p><p>  Most of the stories center around the community the Finks found at IU. Carolyn relates stories about shared meals and parties, shared problems and solutions, shared studies. In addition to gatherings at friends' homes, students spent time at Nick's Olde English Hut, George's, and the Oaks. Fink expresses appreciation for Nick especially, noting that "You could not thank Nick, you could not flatter him; you could just appreciate him, and be sure of getting that big round smile when you entered."</p><p>  Although the memoir revolves more around life than being a student, some stories do relate directly to Carolyn or John's studies. There was a classmate of John's who was old enough to have grandchildren, but who despite her intelligence and interest in microbiology, was unable to find a job after obtaining her doctorate because she was not a young man. Carolyn was continually doubting her decision to pursue her bachelor's degree, but by the end was considering continuing to a master's. Carolyn and John took one course together: a math course with a professor who was "a fine old gentleman who later became famous by writing a history book," and was Carolyn's favorite professor in any subject.</p><p> The memoir ends by reflecting on John's graduation and the eight years the couple spent at IU.</p><p> These personal anecdotes have themes familiar to all students of the era, and to students more generally: the effects of the GI bill on college demographics, especially with regards to marriage and the place of students' wives, the hardships that come from living on a student's budget, and figuring out by trial and error how to own a house or a car.</p>  </scopecontent>
