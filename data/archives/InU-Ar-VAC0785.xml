    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Born on February 19, 1904 in New Haven, Connecticut, Frederic Cowles Schmidt received his Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees from Brown University in 1927 and 1928 respectively. He received his doctorate in Physical Chemistry in 1931 from Brown University as well. In this same year, he married Ruth Howell Champlin.</p><p> Though he worked in applied chemistry and industrial research while earning his degrees, teaching became the focus of Schmidt's career after he received his Ph.D. In 1932 he accepted a position as an instructor at Union College in Schenectady, New York. He eventually became associate professor and also received visiting professorships at Albany College of Pharmacy and at Yale University. In 1947 he came to Indiana University as an associate professor and was promoted to professor in 1951. He also received a position as visiting professor at the University of Hawaii in the summer of 1967. The author of many articles, he co-authored two widely used text books with his colleague William Nebergall: <title render="italic">College Chemistry with Qualitative Analysis</title> and <title render="italic">General Chemistry.</title> </p><p> Schmidt's devotion to teaching chemistry to college students was recognized in 1961 when he received the Herman F. Lieber Award for Distinguished Teaching. He was also involved with the teaching of chemistry in high schools, serving as director of the annual I.U. Summer Institute for High School Teachers of Chemistry from 1965-1969. Schmidt retired from Indiana University with emeritus status in 1969 after 22 years of service. He died on November 18, 1975.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>This small collection spans the years 1933-1967 and contains materials pertaining to some of the courses Schmidt taught at Indiana University as well as his involvement with the Institute for High School Teachers of Chemistry. It is organized into one series: Teaching files. </p><p> The collection is arranged alphabetically by folder heading. Approximately half of the collection consists of lecture notes, syllabi, assignment and exam questions, and other handouts for some of the chemistry courses Schmidt taught during the 1950s and 1960s. There is also a small amount of correspondence dated 1962-1963 regarding the placement and exemption test given to incoming students. Items containing student grades have been removed from these folders. </p><p> The remainder of the collection is related to the Summer Institute for High School Teachers of Chemistry spanning the period from 1961-1967. Included in these folders are items such as blank application forms, programs and attendee lists. Additionally, the 1961 folder contains information regarding the National Science Foundation grants obtained to fund the Institute. There are also photographs of the attendees of the 1962, 1963, 1964 and 1967 Institutes, which have been transferred to the Archives Photograph Collection. Consult the Archives Photographs Curator for access to the images.</p>  </scopecontent>
