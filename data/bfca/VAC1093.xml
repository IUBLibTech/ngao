    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Winner of an American Film and Video Festival blue ribbon, the documentary explores the links and tensions of the sacred and secular in African American culture, as well as chronicling Moore's life from band leader to evangelical preacher. Described by King as "one of the greatest blues singers ever," Moore first gained fame singing in Chicago and Memphis during the 1930s and 1940s. Moore was converted to Christianity in a Chicago night club in 1949, causing him to leave the blues behind at the height of his career. He later became the South's first Black religious disc jockey and a pioneering civil rights radio reporter. </p><p> Guida is an award-winning producer and director. His other documentaries include <emph render="italic">When You Make a Good Crop,</emph> a CINE Golden Eagle winner about Italian American farmers, and <emph render="italic">All Day and All Night,</emph> a New Directors/New Films entry about the music of Beale Street.</p>  </bioghist>
