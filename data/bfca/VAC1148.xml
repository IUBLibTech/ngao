    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>William Miles, President of Miles Educational Film Productions Inc. has produced and directed numerous award-winning public television documentaries including <emph render="italic">I Remember Harlem</emph>, <emph render="italic">Men of Bronze</emph>,<emph render="italic">The Different Drummer: Blacks in the Military</emph>, and<emph render="italic">Black Champions</emph>.</p><p> William Miles' life's work is dedicated to exploring the history, culture and achievements of African Americans, from their arrival in America in the 16th century (depicted in his award-winning PBS series, <emph render="italic">I Remember Harlem</emph>), to their achievements as astronauts and scientists (examined in his PBS special <emph render="italic">Black Stars in Orbit</emph>). A member of the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame, Mr. Miles has also received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Association for Independent Video and Filmmakers in acknowledgment of his outstanding contribution to the history of African Americans on film.</p><p> The only African American independent producer based at WNET/Thirteen in New York, Mr. Miles has produced fifteen films dedicated to African American history and achievement that have been broadcast nationwide as specials. Mr. Miles' films are based on in-depth historical research and are committed to the dissemination of history to a broad national audience on public television and educational institutions throughout the country. Mr. Miles, in cooperation with WNET, produces study guides to accompany his films, and actively participates in the films' distribution.</p><p> Miles spent three years researching material for <emph render="italic">I Remember Harlem</emph>, a four-hour special which traced Harlem's 350-year history, evoking one of America's most vibrant and volatile communities. As a visual counterpart to the oral histories in the film, Miles unearthed old photographs and motion picture films and newsreel footage, much of it rare and never before seen on television. In early <date normal="1982">1982</date>, one year after it was broadcast, <emph render="italic">I Remember Harlem</emph> won an Alfred I. Dupont-Columbia University Citation and an American Film Festival Award.</p><p> In <date normal="1977">1977</date>, Miles gained recognition with the debut of <emph render="italic">Men of Bronze</emph> at the New York Film Festival and its subsequent national public television airing later that year. The film won an American Film Festival Award and a CINE Golden Eagle Award in <date normal="1978">1978</date>. <emph render="italic">Men of Bronze</emph> is an emotional outpouring of memories and anecdotes, combined with treasured photos and footage, of the all-black 369th Infantry Regiment which fought under the French flag during the First World War.</p><p> Miles' penchant for creating historical documentaries was nurtured through twenty-five years of restoring archival films and early feature classics with Killiam Shows, Inc. and the Walter Reade Organization, Inc. His editing credits include the series called <emph render="italic">The Silent Years</emph> with Orson Welles and Lillian Gish, and <emph render="italic">Thomas Hardy's Wessex</emph>, a half-hour episode for the poetry series <emph render="italic">Anyone for Tennyson</emph>, which won a Chicago Film Festival Award in <date normal="1977">1977</date>.</p><p> In <date normal="1983">1983</date>, Miles produced <emph render="italic">The Different Drummer: Blacks in the Military</emph>. The three-part series, which aired on public television, illuminated the often-neglected history of black patriotism and involvement in America's military conflicts from Colonial times to the present. Miles received the D. Parke Gibson Award in Journalism and the <date normal="1984">1984</date> CEBA Award for Excellence for his work on this series.</p><p> In <date normal="1986">1986</date>, Miles produced <emph render="italic">Paul Robeson: Man of Conscience</emph> for WNET/New York and Janus Films. This hour long documentary celebrated Paul Robeson the athlete, scholar, singer, actor and early activist against racial injustice. Miles also produced <emph render="italic">Black Champions</emph>, a three-part documentary mini-series, which was presented by WNET/New York on national television. The series provided a vivid account of black athletes and their accomplishments throughout the 20th Century.</p><p> William Miles is also the recipient of the American Association for State and Local History Award in <date normal="1978">1978</date> and <date normal="1981">1981</date>, the Black Harlem Award, and the Blackfrica Promotions Award in 1981.</p><p> Miles co-produced <emph render="italic">James Baldwin: The Price of the Ticket</emph>, a 90-minute documentary aired on National PBS for <emph render="italic">American Masters </emph>in August <date normal="1989">1989</date>. Miles' next project was <emph render="italic">Black Stars in Orbit</emph>, the story of African American astronauts, which aired on PBS in February <date normal="1990">1990</date>.</p><p> In <date normal="1992">1992</date>, Miles co-directed and co-produced <emph render="italic">Liberators: Fighting on Two Fronts in World War II</emph> with Nina Rosenblum. This ninety minute documentary examines African American soldiers in World War II and their fight against racism in the military as well as at home. <emph render="italic">Liberators</emph> received a nomination in the Best Documentary Feature category at the <date normal="1993">1993</date> Academy Awards and was awarded the IDA Award by the International Documentary Association in <date normal="1992">1992</date>.</p><p> Mr. Miles has also served as the official historian of the 369th Regiment Armory in Harlem, whose collection he organized and cataloged. His involvement with African American veterans' organizations and prior films on African Americans in the military has won the respect of military men and women and veterans, who look to him to honor and preserve their contributions to history.</p><p> William Miles is a member of the International Documentary Association, and is a member of the board of advisors for the National Black Programming Consortium, Production Partners for Black and Hispanic Images and Media Alliance.</p>  </bioghist>
