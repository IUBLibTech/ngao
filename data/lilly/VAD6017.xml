      <p>The originator of the newsletters is considered to have been François Métra, 1714-1786,
        said to have been a banker and at one time a correspondent of the King of Prussia, who got
        into trouble and fled to Holland where he compiled his "correspondence" from materials
        supplied to him from Paris, according to the <title render="italic">Oxford Companion to
          French Literature</title> (1959). He was associated in this work with Guillaume Imbert de
        Bordeaux, Alexandre Balthasar Laurent Grimod de la Reynière, and others.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>The Alströmer mss., 1779-1784 and 1865, are a series of newsletters in French addressed in
        a number of instances to Baron Alströmer of Gothembourg, Sweden. (There are no newsletters
        for the year 1783 in the Alströmer mss.) The newsletters were published on a weekly basis
        from Neuwied, 1775-1793, as <title render="italic">Correspondance littéraire secrète</title>
        in 19 volumes. They were re-issued in part in London as <title render="italic"
          >Correspondance secrète, politique &amp; littéraire</title> in 1787-1790 in 18 volumes
        (Skatline Reprints, Genève, 1967. Main DC136 .A2 C8 1967). A Paris edition came out in
        1793.</p>
      <p> A substantial number of the newsletters in the Alströmer mss. are published in Métra's
          <title render="italic">Correspondance</title>, particularly those from Versailles, but
        none of the newsletters from Paris in 1784 are included in the London edition of 1787-1790.
        There is significant variation in the paragraphs of the printed London edition and the
        holograph newsletters in the Alströmer mss. </p>
      <p> A discussion of Métra's <title render="italic">Correspondance</title> occurs in Melchior
        Grimm avec un appendice sur la correspondance secrète de Métra by Edmond Henri Adolph
        Scherer, Paris, Calman Levy, 1887, pages 459-478 (Main DC137 .G8 S3). </p>
      <p> In 1866 there appeared <title render="italic">Correspondance secrète inedite sur Louis
          XVI, Marie Antoinette la cour et la ville de 1777 à 1792</title> with a preface by
        Mathurin Francois Adolphe de Lescure in two volumes at Paris, Henri Plon (Lilly DC136 .A2
        L62). These newsletters are also from Métra's <title render="italic">Correspondance</title>
        but published from holograph copies found in the library at St. Petersburg, formerly in two
        Polish collections designated as Doubrowski and Varsovie. One hundred ten of the newsletters
        in the Alströmer mss. are published in the Lescure volumes. </p>
      <p> In 1884 the 178 newsletters of the Alströmer mss. were published separately as <title
          render="italic">Lettres de M. de Kageneck au Baron Alströmer de 1779 à 1784</title> (Lilly
        DC137.5 .M6 L65) with a preface by Louis Antoine Leouzon Le Duc in Paris, G. Charpentier.
        (These too are from Métra's <title render="italic">Correspondance</title>.) Written in many
        hands, 81 of the newsletters are addressed to "Monsieur Baron Alströmer, Conseiller de
        Commerce, Directeur de la Compagnie des Indes &amp; Chevalier de l'ordre royal Suevois de
        Wasa à Gothembourg." Baron Alströmer has been identified as Clas Alströmer, 1736-1794,
        businessman and botanist. </p>
      <p> Six of the newsletters have appended unpublished personal notes written in German and
        addressed to Patrick: 1781, Oct. 30; 1782, Jan. 27, Mar. 28 (from Copenhagen), May 1, July 2
        and 8. A seventh newsletter, 1782, Sept. 9, has an unpublished appended note in French
        written from Frankfort. Patrick has been tentatively identified as the brother of Claes
        Alströmer, also a businessman and music patron, who lived from 1733 to 1804. The personal
        note appended to the newsletter of 1782, July 30, mentions Johan, a third Alströmer brother,
        1742-1788, industrialist. </p>
      <p> Another unpublished personal note about "l'irrégularité des poste" is appended to the
        newsletter of 1779, Nov. 20 and signed L Chambellan. Chambellan is mentioned in the personal
        note appended to 1782, Mar. 28, and the newsletter of 1782, May 6, bears a wax seal stamped
        L C. Leouzon Le Duc notes two of the above Chambellan references on page ix of his preface. </p>
      <p> Sixty-two of the newsletters bear red or black wax seals, three with the motto, In Valore
        Virtus, which have been identified by Leouzon Le Duc as bearing the Kageneck family crest.
        The family member may have been Jacques Bruno de Kageneck, born in 1734, who became
        acquainted with Alströmer during the latter's sojourn in France. </p>
      <p> The newsletters (with a total of 669 pages) have been characterized as gossipy accounts
        from the courts of Europe, with both musical and literary references such as Puccini and
        Voltaire. Events reported include the American Revolution with the names of Benjamin
        Franklin, Paul Jones, Lafayette and Washington. An alphabetical name index is published in
        Volume II of the Lescure edition. </p>
      <p> Accompanying the Alströmer mss. are two letters in French from historians about the
        newsletters. In [18]65 on October 24 [Mathieu] A[uguste] Geffroy, 1820-1895, wrote a four
        page letter, 13cm., with embossed initials A G, to an unidentified recipient. He is
        returning the Alströmer documents and thinks that they are worthless since he recalls having
        seen many such hand-written gazettes, especially at Skokloster in Sweden. </p>
      <p> In an undated one page letter, 27.5cm., And[re] Fryxell, 1795-1881, Swedish historian,
        writes to "Votre Excellence" that there is no condition attached to the presentation of
        these historical documents. </p>
      <p> Other related materials include two early accountings of the number of newsletters in the
        collection, and a note in the hand (verified in a statement from the dealer) of Hughes Marie
        Henri Fournier, 1821-1898, French diplomat to Stockholm between 1866-1872, which says that
        the Alströmer newsletters were given to him by Fryxell. </p>
      <p> A survey of the problem of the Métra <title render="italic">Correspondance</title> may be
        found in J. Viktor Johansson, <title render="italic">Sur la Correspondance littéraire
          secrète</title>, Goteborg and Paris, 1960 (Main PG273 .J67).</p>
