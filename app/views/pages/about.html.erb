  <h2>About Archives Online</h2>
  <p>Indiana University (IU) Bloomington Libraries, with support from the Indiana University Office of the Bicentennial, and in close collaboration with the <a href="https://uisapp2.iu.edu/confluence-prd/x/uYTYHg">Archives Online Working Group</a>, made up of representatives across the IU campuses, developed and implemented a shared set of best practices, workflows, and software to facilitate the management, description, digitization, digital preservation, and discovery of archival and special collections for all IU campuses. Motivated by decreasing barriers for description and digitization and increasing access to our students and scholars, Indiana University adopted <a href="https://archivesspace.org/">ArchivesSpace</a> for managing/creating archival and special collections, and collaboratively developed <a href="https://library.stanford.edu/projects/arclight">ArcLight</a>, initiated by Stanford University Libraries, for the discovery and delivery of collection descriptions/finding aids.</p>
